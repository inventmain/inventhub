                    <div>
                        <p>Patents should be the fruits and engines of innovation, but the reality is often grim. We've seen too many innovators facing the same challenges:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Numerous idle patents becoming ongoing cost centers</li>
                            <li>Low return on investment, discouraging further innovation</li>
                            <li>Weak bargaining power with single patents, failing to realize commercial value</li>
                            <li>Prohibitively high costs of independent enforcement actions</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>InventHub was created to break this cycle. We believe that by assembling scattered innovative strengths into a collaborative network, we can systematically solve these pain points and restore innovation to its rightful value.</p>

                    <p>We aggregate scattered, individual patents into high-value portfolios and manage the entire commercialization process.<br>We are more than just agents; we are your asset managers.</p>

                        <h3>Aggregate & Package Flexibly</h3>
                        <p>We bring together high-value patents, strategically combining them into "patent packages" with strong market appeal. This strategy of "unifying parts into a whole" significantly boosts licensing or sales success rates and strengthens your defensive position in the industry, achieving a value greater than the sum of its parts (1+1>2).</p>

                        <p>Your patent assets no longer stand alone. InventHub has established deep partnerships with authoritative bodies like the Shanghai Intellectual Property Exchange Center, gaining official recognition. This brings greater credibility, broader market exposure, and more secure transaction guarantees for your assets.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Traditional patent pools have a relatively fixed model. InventHub is a more flexible and open "aggregation network." We don't require you to transfer your patents; instead, we dynamically create "patent packages" based on market opportunities. Your patents can join or leave as needed, giving you greater autonomy.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Not at all. InventHub does not affect your right to use, independently license, or sell your patents at any time. We serve as a new and efficient channel for your asset monetization, not a restriction.</p>
